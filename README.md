# Introduction
---
Quantum-LBFGS is a Riemannian limited-memory BFGS optimizer designed for quantum computing, specifically targeting the manifold of fixed-rank Hermitian Positive Semi-Definite (PSD) matrices. It leverages the Bures-Wasserstein metric within a quotient geometry framework to achieve state-of-the-art convergence rates for quantum state optimization.
